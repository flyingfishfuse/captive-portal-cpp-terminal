# captive-portal-cpp-terminal
captive portal based in c++ with an ncurses based command line functionality consisting of several options allowing for implementation of the Beef Framework and Bettercap in your attack... or even legal use, this is going to have an actual (hopefully)  secure authentication implementation using hashing and maybe other methods


the following libraries are needed ta this point to compile:

  https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver
  Boost/algorithm 
  Boost/filesystem
  Boost/program_options 
  
  I'm NOT going ot be done iwth this for. aLong time but I'm going to make this my primary project... it has enough different parts I can jump around to keep rfom burning out on amy one single part. Its also neato and useful and I haven't seen what I'm trying ot do except for fluxion and its older and doesn't do what Im planning.
  
  The idea of htis tool is that it presents a captive portal setup to the network of your choice. You can either choose to make this YOUR network or SOMEONE ELSE'S (illegal without permission) 
  
  If you choose to use someone elses network,  I give you a few choices how.
 
  I also give you the option to beefhook every host that gets caught in the attack
